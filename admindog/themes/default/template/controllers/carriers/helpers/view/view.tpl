This means sending yours parcels using your local postal service, or having a contract with a private carrier which in turn will ship your parcels to your customers. In order to have PrestaShop suggest the most adequate carrier to your customers during their order checkout process, you need to register all the carriers with which you have chosen to work.'}</p>
